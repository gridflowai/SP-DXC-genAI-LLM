In Beijing, one of the major environmental challenges is air pollution, which is caused by heavy traffic, industrial emissions, and coal-fired power plants. The city often experiences severe smog and haze, leading to health problems and environmental degradation. Beijing has taken steps to improve air quality, including implementing stricter emissions standards, promoting clean energy sources, and limiting vehicle emissions. Water pollution is another issue in Beijing, as the city's rivers and lakes are contaminated with industrial waste and agricultural runoff.\n",

New Delhi has implemented measures to address air pollution, such as restricting vehicle usage, banning certain types of firecrackers, and promoting cleaner fuels. Water pollution is another issue in New Delhi, as the city's rivers and groundwater sources are contaminated with sewage, industrial waste, and agricultural runoff.\n",

    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Summarized Conversation Storage**: Instead of keeping a raw, unmodified history of the conversation, the memory stores a **summarized** version of previous conversation snippets.\n",
    "- The summarization is performed by an **LLM** (Large Language Model), ensuring the most relevant information is retained while minimizing token usage.\n",

    "**Functionality:**\n",
    "- This memory type stores conversation snippets in a summarized form, allowing more efficient use of tokens by condensing long conversations.\n",
    "- To perform the summarization, the memory constructor needs to have access to an LLM, which will handle the summarization process.\n",

    "**Use Case:**\n",
    "- **ConversationSummaryMemory** is useful for longer conversations where token limits are a concern, allowing the model to maintain context while preventing excessive token usage by summarizing the dialogue.\n"

    "The **ConversationBufferWindowMemory** is another efficient memory type for managing conversation context. It functions like short-term memory, keeping only a set number of recent conversation exchanges while dropping older ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Windowed Raw Conversation Storage**: The memory retains the most recent conversation snippets in their **raw, unmodified form**.\n",
    "- The number of stored exchanges is controlled by the `k` parameter, which defines the size of the window, i.e., how many of the latest interactions to keep in memory.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Functionality:**\n",
    "- The memory acts as a sliding window, keeping the last `k` interactions and dropping older ones. This reduces both the aggregate token count and the number of tokens processed per call.\n",
    "- By limiting the number of exchanges stored, the model can maintain relevant context while staying within token limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:**\n",
    "- **ConversationBufferWindowMemory** is useful when you want to keep a recent context without overwhelming the model with the entire conversation history. It allows efficient use of tokens while retaining recent exchanges for coherent responses.\n"
