    "Reasons to Split Documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handle Non-Uniform Document Lengths**: Documents in real-world collections vary greatly in size. Splitting helps maintain consistent processing across all documents.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Overcome Model Input Size Constraints**: Many language and embedding models have maximum input limits. Splitting enables us to process larger documents that would otherwise exceed these restrictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Improve Representation Quality**: For longer documents, embeddings or representations may lose quality when capturing excessive information. Splitting allows for more focused, accurate representations of each part.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Enhance Retrieval Precision**: In retrieval systems, splitting enables more granular search results, allowing for precise matching between query terms and relevant document sections.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Optimize Computational Resources**: Processing smaller text chunks can save memory and allow for better parallelization, making processing tasks more efficient.\n"
